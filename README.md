# Tech Stack and Softwares used
1. Frontend : HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, BootStrap
2. Backend : Python flask
3. Database : MySQL
4. ML model : Jupyter Notebook

# Libraries and Toolkits used
Python : NumPy, Pandas, ast (Abstract Syntax Trees), pickle

ML : ntlk (Natural Language Toolkit), sklearn (scikit-learn)

# Future Scope
Like/Dislike : The option to like or dislike a movie adds the movie to the user's like/dislike list. As of now, I am just accumulating the data. This can be further extended by using the like/dislike list to recommend movies to the user.

Watch Movie : The watch movie option currently displays the same movie intro for all the movies. In the future, it can be customized according to the movie selected.

Collabrative Filtering : The model currently uses a content-based recommendation system. It can be converted into a hybrid system by adding a collaborative filtering mechanism.
